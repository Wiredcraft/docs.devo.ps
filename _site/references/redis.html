<p>Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code>services:
  redis: &#39;*&#39;
configuration:
  redis:
    port: 16379
    bind: 0.0.0.0
</code></pre><p>Install Redis on the node, making it listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) and on port TCP/16379 instead of TCP/6379 default.</p>
