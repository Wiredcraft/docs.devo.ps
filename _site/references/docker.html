<p>Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code>services:
  docker: &#39;*&#39;
</code></pre><p>Add support for Docker containers on the node.</p>
<p>Note that the server will be restarted in order to apply the proper option to the kernel.</p>
