title: Tasks
---

Tasks are simple sequences of commands performed on designed [nodes](/manual/nodes) of a repository upon certain events (aka "triggers").

## Task file

As with nodes, you define a task using a simple YAML (`.yml`) file.

*We currently require that you name the file as the task id (see example) and save it in the `tasks/` folder. We are working on adding support for arbitrary file names and folders, allowing you to save multiple tasks in a single file.*

For example, we could add a `task.yml` file with the following content:

    id: deploy
    type: task
    name: Deployment pipeline

    triggers:
      webhooks:
        - deploy
    
    targets:
      - nodejs_server
    
    vars:
      build: /opt/build_temp
      domain: example.com
    
    steps:
      - run: sudo mkdir -p {{ build }} && sudo chown -R devops. {{ build }}
      - run: devops git clone
        options:
          from: https://github.com/Wiredcraft/octokan.com.git
          to: {{ build }}
          version: master
      - run: cd {{ build }}; make build ; cp -a _site/* /var/www/{{ domain }}
      - run: devops nginx vhost add
          options:
            domain: {{ domain }}
            port: 80
            routes:
              - uri: /
                type: proxy
                to: http://localhost:3000

  <dt class='optional'><code><span class='type'>object</span> vars</code></dt>

  <dt class='optional'><code><span class='type'>object</span> triggers</code></dt>

    A series of commands and tasks to be run one after the other.
    <dl>
      <dt><code><span class='type'>string</span> run</code></dt>
      <dd>A command to be run; it may be an inline shell command, the path to one of the [scripts](/manual/scripts) available in the repository or a `devops` command. <a href='#steps'>Read more about steps below</a>.</dd>
      
      <dt class='optional'><code><span class='type'>object</span> options</code></dt>
      <dd>An object of options to be passed to the command if it is a devops command.</dd>

      <dt><code><span class='type'>object</span> targets</code></dt>
      <dd>A list of nodes id on which to run the command. **This takes precedence over the targets defined at the root of the task**.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

## Steps

The `steps` attribute defines the series of commands that composes the task. These commands can be of 3 kinds:

- **Inline command**: regular shell command. For example:

      steps:
        - run: mkdir folder

- **Script**: you can define shell, python or Ruby scripts in the `scripts/` folder, making it convenient to reuse commands across multiple tasks or simply isolate a complex set of commands. For example:

      steps:
        - run: devops scripts/some_script.sh

    *To use packages (`pip` or `gems`) we recommend you use the configuration of respectively the [Python](/services/python) or [Ruby](/services/ruby) services rather than installing them from within a script.*

- **devops command**: services installed on your nodes usually come with some helper commands. A devops command looks like `devops {SERVICE} {COMMAND}` where `{SERVICE}` is the name of the service and `{COMMAND}` the name of the specific command. Some of these commands require you to define options. For example, adding a virtual host to your Nginx service can be done as follow:

      steps:
        - run: devops nginx vhost add
          options:
            domain: example.com
            port: 80
            routes:
              - uri: /
                type: proxy
                to: http://localhost:3000

    *As for the scripts, we use the `devops` keyword. Services documentations list the devops commands available for each service. See for example [Nginx list of commands](/services/nginx#commands).*

Commands are run as the `devops` user on targeted nodes. You can however switch users by using the `sudo` command in scripts or inline commands.

## Triggers

Tasks are run whenever one of the triggers conditions are met.

*We currently only support manual and webhook triggers. We are working on adding support for cron and 3rd party events (GitHub, TravisCI, NewRelic...). Webhooks are however flexible enough that you should be able to integrate most 3rd parties already.*

### Webhook

Webhooks allow you define HTTP callbacks which you, or a 3rd party, can query with a `POST` payload.

The following definition in a task:

    triggers:
      webhooks:
        - path: some/secret/url
        - path: some/other/url

*While we are considering more security measures, like restricting access to webhooks for user defined IPs, we recommend that you use obfuscted/complex URLs for your webhooks (if you wish to keep it private).*

Will automatically create the following endpoints:

    https://wh.devo.ps/{USER}/{REPO}/some/secret/url
    https://wh.devo.ps/{USER}/{REPO}/some/other/url

Where `{USER}` is the repository owner and `{REPO}` the name of the repository.

When a webhook receives a `POST` payload, it gets converted a JSON object and assigned to the `{{ payload }}` [variable](/manual/variables).
