title: Nodes
---

A node is usually a server, either physical or virtual. However, it may also refer to another component of your infrastructure: a firewall, a load balancer or storage (e.g. S3).

*Currently, we only support servers but are actively working on adding support for load balancers, firewalls and clusters.*

## Node file

Each node is defined in a YAML (`.yml`) file.

*We currently require that you name the file as the node id (see example) and save it in the `nodes/` folder. We are working on adding support for arbitrary file names and folders, allowing you to save multiple nodes in a single file.*

For example, we could add a `web.yml` file with the following content:

    id: nodejs_server
    name: Node.js server
    type: server

    provider:
      name: digitalocean
      size: 66
      location: 3
      image: ubuntu14.04

    services:
      nodejs: '*'
      nginx: '*'

    configuration:
      nodejs:
        packages:
          - gulp
          - forever
          - bower      

Once pushed to `master`, this will provision a 512MB Ubuntu server on Digital Ocean (using the [provider credentials defined in your profile](/manual/profile#providers)) in their `San Francisco 1` datacenter (location and size values are [documented in the provider section](/providers/digital_ocean/)). It will also install [Nginx](/services/nginx) and [Node.js](/services/nodejs) and additionally add the the `gulp`, `forever` and `bower` packages to Node.js.

## Services & Configuration

A service refers to a technology you want to add support for on your node; it may be a database (MySQL, CouchBase, MongoDB), a language (PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js), a Web server (NGINX, Apache), a reverse-proxy or a load-blanacer (Varnish), HAproxy, Squid)...

When adding a service to a node, you can specify a version or use the `*` as a wildcard for the latest avaiable version:

    services:
      nginx: '*'

*We are currently only support the wildcard option but will soon enable users to pick a specific version of a service and handle service ugprades.*

## SSH keys & Users

A `devops` user is created on all servers provisioned by devo.ps. This user is used by our service to maintain your servers (add services, update configuration...) and orchestrate [tasks](/manual/tasks).

Additionally, we add the [SSH keys defined in the profile](/manual/profile#ssh) of all collaborators to the server's `authorized_keys` file for the `devops` user. This means you can log in as the `devops` user by simply running the following command:

<code class='terminal pre'>ssh devops@{IP ADDRESS}</code>

*The IP address can be retrieved both from the Web UI (in the node's details) or using the CLI.*

If you have installed the [CLI](/manual/CLI.html), you can also use one of the following commands:

- From anywhere on your workstation:

    <code class='terminal pre'>devops ssh --repo={REPOSITORY} {NODE_ID}</code>

    Where `{REPOSITORY}` is the name of the repository and `{NODE_ID}` the id of the node you want to log into.

- From within the local repository clone:

    <code class='terminal pre'>devops ssh {NODE_ID}</code>

    *If you only have 1 node in the repository, `devops ssh` would suffice.*
