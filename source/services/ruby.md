Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Multiple versions of Ruby (and gems) can be installed with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#groom-your-apps-ruby-environment-with-rbenv). The various versions are globally available in `/opt/rbenv`.


## Examples

* ### System only

  ```example
  services:
    ruby: '*'

  configuration:
    ruby:
      gems:
        - rails
        - compass
  ```

  We are installing here the default version of Ruby available on the system via the package manager (apt), and install globally the gems `rails` and `compass`

* ### Single custom Ruby version

  ```example
  services:
    ruby: '*'

  configuration:
    ruby:
      versions:
        1.9.3-p551: {}
      gems:
        - compass
  ```

  We are installing here both the default version of Ruby available on the system via the package manager (apt), and the version `1.9.3-p551`. We install as well `compass` using the **system version** of Ruby, but install no extra gems with the `1.9.3-p551` version.

* ### Multiple custom Ruby versions and gems

  ```example
  services:
    ruby: '*'

  configuration:
    ruby:
      versions:
        1.9.3-p551:
          gems:
            - rails
        2.0.0-p598:
          gems:
            - rails
  ```

  We are installing here the default version of Ruby available on the system via the package manager (apt), as well as 2 extra versions of Ruby (`1.9.3-p551` and `2.0.0-p598`). No gems are installed for the system version of Ruby, but `rails` is installed for both extra versions of Ruby.

## Plugins of rbenv

The following rbenv plugins are installed to ease the overall experience:
- [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build#readme): is used to build the requested versions of Ruby

Since the Ruby versions are built from source, the sync operation may take longer than expected and depends on the computing power of the your server.
