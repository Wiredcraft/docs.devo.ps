Nginx is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a Web server.

## vhosts

Save for a few settings, you'll most likely end up adding vhosts to your Nginx configuration.

In a nutshell, each vhost defines a directory of files, where your application or Web site resides, and a list of domains associated with it. Whenever you add a vhost, we'll create a Web root associated with its id: `var/www/{vhost_id}` where `{vhost_id}` is the id of your vhost.

<em>You can use the `webroot` if you're serving files out of a sub-folder of the default Web root. For example, if you serve files out of the `public/` subfolder of your app, adding the `webroot: public` to your vhost will make it serve files out of the `/var/www/my_vhost/public` folder.</em>

## Routes

Routes allow you to define a list of ways to handle different types of requests, based on the `uri` (order matter, first routes in the list have precedence). These routes have a `type` attribute:

- `custom` (default): routes of this type have a `custom` attribute that will take the content of a regular [Nginx location block](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location).
- `fastcgi`: sends requests to a fastcgi backend or upstream. Common for **PHP apps**.
- `proxy`: sends requests to a http proxy (local or remote). Common for **node.js apps**.
- `websocket`: assumes requests are handled as websocket traffic.
- `uwsgi`: sends requests to a uwsgi service. Common for **Python apps**.
- `static`: serves files as static assets without any processing.

<em><strong>You can add supported technologies with the `support` attribute</strong>. This attribute willl help your vhost figure out what index to serve. By default it includes `index.html` and `index.html`, adding `php` to `support` will extend it to `index.php`.</em>

## Example

    configuration:
      nginx:
        vhosts:
          - id: my_vhost
            port: 8080
            domain: mydomain.com
            aliases: alias.mydomain.com alias2.mydomain.com
            webroot: public
            support:
              - php
            routes:
              - uri: '@php'
                type: fastcgi
                to: localhost:9001
              - uri: '~ ^/(app|app_dev|config)\.php(/|$)'
                type: custom
                custom: >
                  try_files $uri @php

We here define a vhost that will XXX.

This configuration will generate the following Nginx configuration file (also linked and enabled in `sites-enabled`):

### /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_vhost

```snippet
server {
    listen   8080;
    root /var/www/my_vhost/public;

    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/my_vhost-access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/my_vhost-error.log;

    # Make site accessible from http://localhost/
    # server_name _;
    server_name mydomain.com alias.mydomain.com alias2.mydomain.com;

    location @php {
        # Route type: fastcgi
        fastcgi_pass localhost:9001;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        # NOTE: You should have "cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0;" in php.ini
        fastcgi_index index.php; 
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ ^/(app|app_dev|config)\.php(/|$) {
        # Route type: custom
        try_files $uri @php
    }
}
```
