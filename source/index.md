- The **manual** explains the main features of devo.ps. Make sure to read the pages about [nodes](/manual/nodes) and [tasks](/manual/tasks), the two core concepts of this product.
- The **providers** section explains the settings for the providers we support (AWS, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, Linode).
- The **services** section gathers the references of all the [services] you can install on your node (think technologies; NGINX, MySQL or Ruby).
