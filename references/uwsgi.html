<p>The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building hosting services.</p>
<p>Application servers (for various programming languages and protocols), proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented using a common api and a common configuration style.</p>
<p>Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended to support more platforms and languages.</p>
<p>Currently, you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C.</p>
<p>The &quot;WSGI&quot; part in the name is a tribute to the namesake Python standard, as it has been the first developed plugin for the project.</p>
<p>Versatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability are the strengths of the project (and the only rules followed).</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code>services:
  uwsgi: &#39;*&#39;
</code></pre><p>Add support for uWSGI on the node, installing Python Emperor to manage the applications.</p>
<p>Note that the applications are managed via dedicated tasks.</p>
