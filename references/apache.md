The Number One HTTP Server On The Internet

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient
and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the
current HTTP standards.

Apache httpd has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
April 1996, and celebrated its 17th birthday as a project this February.

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is a project of The Apache Software
Foundation.

## Example

    services:
      apache: '*'
    configuration:
      apache:
        user: root
        worker:
          startservers: 1
