<p>Elasticsearch is a flexible and powerful open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine. Architected from the ground up for use in distributed environments where reliability and scalability are must haves, Elasticsearch gives you the ability to move easily beyond simple full-text search. Through its robust set of APIs and query DSLs, plus clients for the most popular programming languages, Elasticsearch delivers on the near limitless promises of search technology.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code>services:
  elasticsearch: &#39;*&#39;
configuration:
  elasticsearch:
      bind_host: 0.0.0.0
      http_port: 9200
      heap_size: 4g
</code></pre><p>Install ElasticSearch on the node, make it listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0), use the TCP/9200 port for the HTTP access and give the service a maximum of 4GB of RAM to operate.</p>
<p>Note that if your node does not have enough RAM the service will eventually crash.</p>
